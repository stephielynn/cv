        <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="http://gidgetdigital.com">Gidget Digital</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I am freelance web developer and designer. I started out in the construction industry, beginning as a receptionist in a small family-owned company. Within 5 years, I was working for a large commercial architect in downtown Orlando in the
          Healthcare division. One morning on my way to my desk, I stopped at a window overlooking the impressive Orlando skyline from the 17th floor, taking in the sunrise and contemplating the long hours and hard work that led me to the priveledge
          of standing in that spot to appreciate it. It was then that it hit me, as though the tiny cars below spelled out some shocking, unexepected truth: This isn't my path. My real passion has been web development since I first discovered the
          internet twenty years ago. I'm forever grateful for the learning opportunities and mentors I've had along my journey, and I'm so excited to begin my next chapter.</p>
